/**
 * SafeAnalytics - Vercel Analytics with URL fragment stripping
 *
 * SECURITY CRITICAL: This wrapper prevents analytics from capturing the URL fragment,
 * which contains the AES-256-GCM decryption key.
 *
 * Background:
 * - ShadowSend stores decryption keys in the URL fragment (e.g., shadowsend.com/f/abc123#key)
 * - Vercel Analytics by default captures the full URL including the fragment
 * - If the fragment is leaked to analytics, the entire E2E encryption guarantee is broken
 *
 * This component MUST be used instead of importing <Analytics> directly.
 * Any future contributor adding analytics must follow this pattern.
 *
 * @see https://github.com/pankajsattadhish/shadowsend/issues/34
